Version 0.2

Place the InitFromTemplate folder inside your
"sketchbook/tools/" folder.
Folder structure should look like this:

YourSketchbookRoot/tools/InitFromTemplate/tool/InitFromTemplate.jar (executable .jar tool)
YourSketchbookRoot/tools/InitFromTemplate/tool/template.txt (default template)
YourSketchbookRoot/tools/InitFromTemplate/src/InitFromTemplate.java (source code)
YourSketchbookRoot/tools/InitFromTemplate/src/most_basic_template.txt (example template)
YourSketchbookRoot/tools/InitFromTemplate/usage.txt (this file)
YourSketchbookRoot/tools/InitFromTemplate/javadoc/ (contains all javadoc documentation)

Run Processing and look for the menu item in the
"Tools" menu, it should appear as: 
"Initialize from 'template.txt'"

Choose the tool and watch the P5 editor 
get filled with the default template!

You can edit the template file to
have a custom basic set of functions to 
begin with in P5 every time you use the tool.

The template is read from disc every time
so you can actually edit the file even
while P5 is open and active.
